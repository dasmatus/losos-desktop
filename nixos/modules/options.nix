        The release version. It is baked into the image in three places that
        systemd-sysupdate reads back: the UKI's file name on the ESP, the
        partition label of the /usr and /usr-verity partitions, and
        IMAGE_VERSION in os-release. sysupdate orders versions with
        strverscmp(3), so a later build must compare greater.

        The flake sets it from the commit date, which is monotonic along a
        branch. It is not left at a constant default because the failure a
        constant produces is silent: every update would carry the same version
        as the running system, and sysupdate would never install one.
