# The boot screen: Plymouth, with a theme (nixos/branding/splash.script)
# that draws the salmon LosOS boots behind on the dark ground, the system's
# name under it and a line that grows as the boot gets on. Imported by the
# PC image (default.nix) and by the installer's live system, which then
# reads "LosOS Desktop installer is starting" (docs/boot-loaders.md).
#
# The whole start is one picture: GRUB's menu on the same ground with the
# same salmon (grub.nix), then the UKI's own splash, which systemd-stub
# shows while the kernel and initrd load, then Plymouth from the initrd on,
# until the login screen or the installer takes the display. Plymouth comes
# back at shutdown and says the machine is restarting or shutting down.
#
# Plymouth draws on the display it finds in its first seconds, which on a
# UEFI PC is the firmware's framebuffer, in the mode GRUB left. A BIOS
# machine hands GRUB's graphics mode on to the kernel for the same reason
# (grub.cfg). Without either, Plymouth runs in text mode. Esc shows the boot
# log, and Esc again hides it.
#
# Halium phones boot through Android's boot loader and draw nothing until
# the compositor starts, so nixos/halium does not import this.
