# The active-user count, and the choice screens it turns on.
#
# Once a day, and a few minutes into each login, every signed-in user's
# systemd user manager sends the proxy's /ping two lines: an id and the
# architecture. The id is SHA-256 of a random secret that never leaves the
# user's home and the current month, so the proxy can count a user once per
# month and cannot follow anyone from one month to the next. No account, no
# hardware id, no version, nothing about the machine but its architecture.
# The proxy (proxy/src/lib.rs) adds the id to the month's HyperLogLog and
# answers with a policy: whether the browser and search engine choice
# screens are on. It decides from the count; the OS never learns the number.
#
# The policy lands where derisk reads it, $XDG_STATE_HOME/derisk/policy.conf
# (derisk_settings::choice). derisk shows the screens at the next login and
# under Settings, Default apps; until the policy says so they stay hidden.
