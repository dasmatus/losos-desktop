# WPE WebKit, the WebKit port with no toolkit of its own, which the Danube
# browser (src/danube) embeds. nixpkgs packages only WebKitGTK, so this is
# its WebKitGTK of the same version built as the WPE port instead: the same
# dependencies and patches, wpewebkit.org's tarball, and no GTK.
#
# Only the WPEPlatform API is built (docs/danube.md). Its headless platform
# hands each rendered frame to the embedder, which is how Danube draws the
# page inside a window it renders with mcsapi. The legacy libwpe API, the
# DRM platform (a kiosk with no compositor) and the Qt API are not needed,
# and each would add dependencies.
