# This documentation, the Docusaurus site in website/ with docs/ as its
# pages, built to be read offline (docs/troubleshooting.md, the docs.nix
# module). DOCS_OFFLINE gives it hash routes, so every page loads from one
# index.html opened as a file:// URL with no server, and adds
# sections/<page>/<heading>.html, the plain files derisk's error alerts open
# (website/offline-sections.js).
#
# Only docs/ and website/ are its source, so a change anywhere else in the
# repository leaves it as it was. npmDepsHash changes with
# website/package-lock.json: `prefetch-npm-deps website/package-lock.json`.
