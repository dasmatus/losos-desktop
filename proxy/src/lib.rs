//! The decisions behind the GHCR proxy, compiled to WebAssembly.
//!
//! The proxy (`api/proxy.ts`) serves these from one host, all out of this
//! project's GitHub Container Registry namespace:
//!
//! * **A Nix binary cache.** `nix copy --to file://...` writes a narinfo and a
//!   NAR per store path; `tools/nix-cache-push` puts each pair in GHCR as one
//!   OCI artifact, `nix-cache:<store hash>`. Nix asks a cache for
//!   `/<hash>.narinfo` and then for whatever its `URL:` names, and this maps
//!   both onto that artifact. It serves paths CI uploads, alongside
//!   cache.nixos.org for stock nixpkgs packages.
//! * **systemd-sysupdate's update source.** CI pushes each release as an OCI
//!   artifact already (`images:<channel>-<version>-<arch>`), and also under
//!   the moving tag `<channel>-<arch>`. `/updates/<channel>/<arch>/<file>`
//!   serves a file of the newest one, `SHA256SUMS` included, which is all a
//!   `url-file` transfer asks of its source. That is the install side.
//! * **The web flasher's downloads.** The flasher (`website/static/flasher/`)
//!   is a page on another origin, and a browser reads a cross-origin
//!   response only when it says `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, which GHCR's
//!   storage does not. `/flasher/<channel>/<arch>/<file>` serves the GSI's
//!   files of the same release as `/updates/` does, streamed through the
//!   proxy one byte range at a time instead of redirected, and only those.
//! * **CI's build caches.** CI keeps its compiler caches in GHCR as
//!   artifacts split into parts, `losos-ccache:<arch>` for the overlay's
//!   patched GTK and Qt. `/build-cache/<name>/<arch>/<part>` serves one
//!   part, so CI rounds and any other builder fetch them here without a
//!   GHCR login, and with the same names CI pushes them under.
//! * **The active-user count.** `POST /ping` is what each signed-in user's
//!   `losos-ping` timer sends once a day (`nixos/modules/ping.nix`): a
//!   per-user id already hashed with the month, and the architecture. The
//!   proxy adds the id to that month's HyperLogLog in Redis and answers with
//!   the policy that turns the browser and search engine choice screens on
//!   once the count is large enough. [`ping`] and [`policy`] are that half.
//!
//! What lives here is every decision the proxy makes: which request is which,
//! what is a valid name, which layer of a manifest answers it, and how a
//! narinfo is rewritten. The JavaScript around it only performs I/O, because
//! `fetch` is the one thing a module with no imports cannot do. So everything
//! that could let a crafted path reach something it should not is in code
//! that `cargo test` runs.
//!
//! # The interface
//!
//! Strings in, strings out, over linear memory: the host calls `alloc`,
//! writes UTF-8, calls a function, and gets back `(ptr << 32) | len` of a
//! string it must hand to `free` after copying. `alloc`'s buffer is consumed
//! by the call it is passed to. No JSON crosses: the host
//! parses the registry's JSON natively and passes plain lines.
