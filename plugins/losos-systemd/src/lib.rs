//! A pm plugin that reads systemd unit files into a package's permission profile.
//!
//! Every other signal pm has is an inference. ELF analysis reads `DT_NEEDED` and
//! guesses a library path; source scanning finds a string literal that looks like a
//! path and cannot tell a real one from an error message. Both are approximations,
//! and pm's own documentation is careful to say so.
//!
//! A systemd unit is different in kind: it is a **declaration**. `ReadWritePaths=`
//! does not suggest that a service might write somewhere -- it is the list systemd
//! will make writable and nothing else will be. `StateDirectory=` names the one
//! directory systemd creates. So for a package that ships units, the most accurate
//! description of what it needs at run time is already in the package, written by
//! whoever wrote the service, and nothing was reading it.
//!
//! That makes this the one signal in pm that can be *exact* rather than generous,
//! which matters because a profile only becomes useful when someone is willing to
//! promote it out of audit mode.
//!
//! # Conservative on purpose
//!
//! A grant is emitted only where a directive positively says so. In particular, the
//! absence of `PrivateNetwork=yes` is **not** treated as evidence that a service
//! needs the network -- almost no unit sets it, so treating absence as evidence
//! would hand a network grant to everything and mean nothing. Network is granted
//! only for a directive that names networking outright.
//!
//! # What this can reach
//!
//! Nothing. One import, `log`, which returns nothing. pm hands over a file's text and
//! takes a list of grants back.
