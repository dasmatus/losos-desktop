//! A pm plugin that teaches pm about image assembly and bundling.
//!
//! pm's built-in fingerprint table knows compilers, build systems, archivers and
//! coreutils. It does not know the tools that turn a staged tree into something
//! bootable, because those are not build systems -- so today a recipe that calls
//! `qemu-img` or `xorriso` is refused before a single step runs, and this repository
//! worked around that by writing its own cpio and PE writers in Python.
//!
//! This plugin removes the need for those workarounds by naming the tools. It also
//! names `patchelf`, which is the other half of a self-contained bundle: setting
//! `RUNPATH` to `$ORIGIN/../lib` is what lets a package carry its own libraries and
//! resolve them from inside itself rather than from whatever the host happens to
//! have installed.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not do
//!
//! Every tool here is classified as needing [`Capability::Toolchain`] and
//! [`Capability::Coreutils`], and some also [`Capability::Archive`]. **None of them
//! gets [`Capability::Network`]**, and the manifest's ceiling says so, so pm would
//! drop it even if a future edit here asked for it by mistake. An image build that
//! reaches the network is an image build whose contents are not the ones that were
//! reviewed.
//!
//! Nor is any of this a shell. `mkfs.ext4` and friends are named individually rather
//! than by a `mkfs*` prefix so that a typo is an unrecognised command -- which pm
//! reports -- rather than a wildcard that quietly matches something else.
//!
//! # What this can reach
//!
//! Nothing. The component imports one function, `log`, which returns nothing. There is
//! no filesystem here, no clock, no network and no environment: pm hands over a command
//! string and takes an answer back.
