//! A pm plugin that teaches pm about Nix.
//!
//! pm is the system manager in this NixOS image (`docs/nixos.md`), and users can
//! use it to drive the flake -- a build file whose
//! steps are `nix flake check` and `nix build .#image`. pm's fingerprint table
//! knows neither word, so before this plugin such a file was refused before any
//! step ran (C2), with a diagnostic naming the command and nothing else.
//!
//! # What gets a verdict
//!
//! The commands that *read or build* a flake: `nix build`, `nix eval`, `nix
//! flake check|show|metadata`, `nix path-info`, `nix log`, `nix derivation
//! show`, the read-only `nix store` subcommands, `nix hash` and `nix nar`, and
//! their older spellings `nix-build`, `nix-instantiate`, `nix-hash` and the
//! querying operations of `nix-store`.
//!
//! # What is refused, and why that is a feature
//!
//! A plugin cannot make pm refuse anything -- `None` only leaves pm's own "no
//! fingerprint matches" in place. So the refusals below are commands this plugin
//! *recognises* and deliberately declines to size a jail for, with a line in the
//! log saying why, rather than commands it has never heard of:
//!
//! * `nixos-rebuild`, `nixos-install`, `nix-env`, `nix profile`: they change a
//!   machine rather than build something. A build step has no business changing
//!   the machine it runs on, and this OS is not updated that way at all -- an
//!   update is a new `/usr` from systemd-sysupdate (`nixos/modules/update.nix`),
//!   and the image carries no Nix to run a switch with.
//! * `nix run|shell|develop|fmt|bundle|repl|env`, `nix-shell`: each runs a
//!   program the step does not name. A jail sized for `nix` is not a jail sized
//!   for whatever the flake's app turns out to be.
//! * `nix copy`, `nix-copy-closure`, `nix-store --serve|--import|--gc|...`: they
//!   write to or serve a store other than reading the build's own.
//! * `nix flake update|lock|prefetch`, `nix-prefetch-url`, `nix-channel`: they
//!   fetch something newer than what is pinned. A pin moves by hand in this tree
//!   (CLAUDE.md, "Keeping the pins current"), and `flake.lock` is one.
//!
//! # nixpkgs, through the pin and nowhere else
//!
//! The flake's `legacyPackages` is the whole of nixpkgs at the revision
//! `flake.lock` pins, built for the image's stock glibc platform -- the same
//! package set it is made of -- and `.#pm-payloads.<name>` is any of those packages linked
//! statically and checked by Nix itself to refer to nothing in the store, which
//! is what a pm package extracted at `/pkg` can actually run (docs/nixos.md,
//! "nixpkgs in a pm build"). That makes all of nixpkgs reachable from a pm build
//! file without any of it being unpinned, provided the build file names it by a
//! reference that cannot move. So a flake reference that can move gets no
//! verdict either, for the same reason `nix flake update` gets none:
//!
//! * a registry name -- `nixpkgs#hello`, `flake:nixpkgs`, `nixpkgs/nixos-26.05`
//!   -- which resolves to whatever the registry says today, and by default
//!   that is nixpkgs' newest commit on GitHub;
//! * `github:`, `gitlab:` and `sourcehut:` without a commit, and the `git+`
//!   schemes without `rev=`, because a branch or a tag is a name, not content;
//! * a tarball URL without `narHash=`, because the server decides what it holds;
//! * a `<nixpkgs>` lookup path, which is a channel by another name.
//!
//! A path (`/build/src`, `.`) is fine: its own `flake.lock` pins its inputs. So is
//! `--file`, which names a file rather than a flake. `--override-input` replaces
//! one input of a locked flake, so its reference is held to the same rule.
//!
//! # Network, and `--offline`
//!
//! Evaluating a flake can fetch its inputs and building one substitutes from
//! cache.nixos.org, so a verdict normally carries [`Capability::Network`], as
//! pm's own table gives it to `cargo`. The exception is a `nix` command that
//! says `--offline`: that one gets no network, so the jail holds the recipe to
//! what it claimed. `--offline` on its own only turns substituters off and trusts
//! whatever was already downloaded; it is pm's jail that turns "should not fetch"
//! into "cannot fetch". The older `nix-*` commands have no such switch and always
//! get the network. `nix hash` and `nix nar` never do: they read a file.
//!
//! Network in a pm build file is per *file*, not per step (C8), so one step that
//! gets it puts every step of that file on the host network. A build file meant
//! to stay offline has to say `--offline` on every step, and `pm explain` shows
//! whether it did: the fingerprint of an offline step ends in `-offline`.
//!
//! # What this can reach
//!
//! Nothing. The component imports one function, `log`, which returns nothing. pm
//! hands over a command string and takes an answer back.
